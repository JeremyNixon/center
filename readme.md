Developer's Best Friend!

This application allows you to generate some number of paragraphs of lorem-ipsum text or generate a list of users. 
Go to lorem-ipsum/{number of paragraphs} or user-generate/{number of users} to use it.

The project works perfectly on my local machine, but when I deployed to pagoda my project wouldn't render. I tried initializing the git repository in different places than the laravel folder, specifically public and app, but that didn't work either. I also tried using new ssh keys, but no luck. I looked at other deployed laravel projects and they seem to be deployed from the same space. I'm not sure if there's a configuration that I couldn't find. I spent a long time googling about the problem, but I still hadn't solved it, and so I posted to piazza. I can keep trying, but I hope that this could be graded from the github repo.
