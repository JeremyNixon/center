<p>Lots of great takeaways from Lean In.</p>

<p>First and foremost is the question 'What would you do if you weren't afraid? That fear of </p>

<p>exposure is extremely important. People are often insecure about their abilities, but hide it from </p>

<p>themselves and the world by refusing to do things. They think to themselves that if they ever </p>

<p>worked on something or applied themselves they would be extremely effective. But they actually </p>

<p>just fool themselves into self confidence, and deprive themselves of real opportunities for growth </p>

<p>and to have an effect on the world. I do this. I am afraid. </p>

<p>But the answer to the question of what would you do if you weren't afraid is an obvious </p>

<p>choice for concerted effort. I'll devote a free write to what I would actually do if I weren't afraid </p>

<p>(real ultimate workouts/throwing and lots of extracurricular opportunities come to mind), but </p>

<p>in general the answer to that question will both give you a direction and tell you a lot about </p>

<p>yourself. Fear operates in an interesting way: it's as if the most importatnt characteristics about </p>

<p>a person aren't the things that they do but the things that they don't do -- what they're afraid of. </p>

<p>Fear is similar to the chill on honest speech that we all have to protect ourselves and the people </p>

<p>around us. </p>

<p>Lean In's title represent the ambition and self confidence that women should have in </p>

<p>their interactions with the world. But it's generally true -- people are capable of more that they </p>

<p>usually achieve, and that's due to a lack of confidence and ambition. Those qualities are self- fulfilling properties of success. </p>

<p>Fraudulence is interesting: I've mostly experienced her fear of being found out in college </p>

<p>and in relationships. Sometimes I feel like Carolyn and I have fooled each other into thinking </p>

<p>that the other is a deity. I'm still waiting to be found out. I certainly put my best up when I'm with </p>

<p>her, so she has a bad sample of what I'm like. But if I do that every time, I've managed to fake </p>

<p>it till it's real'. If I do it every time she really is in a relationship with a guy that's truly amazing. </p>

<p>And so the person who we pretend to be becomes us. </p>

<p>I've effectively been trying an experiment where I pretend to be the perfect version of </p>

<p>myself for a long time now. What I do with my time journal is an attempt to be that greater self </p>

<p>every day -- and when I follow my schedule it can actually happen. While we aren't only the </p>

<p>things we do, what we do is the metric by which we are judged by all other people -- we alone </p>

<p>judge ourselves by our intentions rather than by our outcomes and actions. So that fakeness </p>

<p>can actually become real. A person who constantly feigns confidence will actually have it. What </p>

<p>is fakeness but mimicry? And how do we learn behavior if not by mimicry? </p>

<p>I certainly need to consider the 50/50 split between parents on domestic responsibility. </p>

<p>This seems like a pretty natural conclusion, that the gender split here is fairly arbitrary and we </p>

<p>should maximise the happiness of both lives by making each side feel like an equal partner </p>

<p>with an equal investment in the relationship. It saddens me when girls (Amy) have little ambition </p>

<p>when their power and potential is so great. And the world suffers when half of it's population is </p>

<p>subjected and subjects itself to lives that are not pushing themselves and their boundaries, not </p>

<p>spent in fields where they have skill and passion.</p>
