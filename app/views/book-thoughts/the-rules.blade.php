<p>The power of habit does a great job giving me a framework for thinking about problems </p>

<p>or understanding real life systems. Reminiscent of Han Feizi's autonomous society, the way </p>

<p>people follow habits in mass does a good job of describing mass behavior.</p>

<p>Interpreting my life through habit is interesting too. My enjoyment of the summer was </p>

<p>defined by a mass of new and positive habits. My obsessiveness is almost certainly a habit that </p>

<p>gives my brain unusual amounts of reward for an experience. Ultimate frisbee and Starcraft are </p>

<p>pretty clear habits with rewards that come as soon as I start. </p>

<p>People are habits. Erica, for example, has a reward at the cue as soon as I see her, </p>

<p>an experience, and then a reward of feeling loved and accepted at the end. Breaking up with </p>

<p>somebody is like ending an addictive habit loop. The same way that smokers get cravings after </p>

<p>they quit, and the way that they can fall back into all of their deep-seated habits as soon as they </p>

<p>give in once, people can get back into relationship with people they've been with before very </p>

<p>easily. </p>

<p>The quality of those relationships is also a matter of habit. Just like a person's </p>

<p>performance is the result of how well their habits line up with improvement in whatever they're </p>

<p>performing. </p>

<p>The idea that all great performers are obsessive seems to be extremely true. I'm </p>

<p>obsessive about the thing's I'm best at, and that obsessiveness leads to a focus on it that is </p>

<p>difficult to replicate with hard work. If we think that time spent in careful focus on an act is what </p>

<p>leads to improvement, then it's so much easier to improve on an obsession. </p>

<p>These habits need to be controlled for me to have any sense of control over my life. </p>

<p>Francis Bacon's improvement through a belief in free will makes sense - those under the illusion </p>

<p>that they have agency and power will exercise that power for their own good. This is a good bias </p>

<p>to have. </p>

<p>The parts on habit change are extremely important. If the functions of a society are </p>

<p>all dependent on it's members performing a specific set of actions habitually, changing those </p>

<p>actions to the productive ones and away from the destructive ones is important economically </p>

<p>and socially. And Individuals with the habits that best cohere with their goals are the people who </p>

<p>are going to find success in what they do. We are what we habitually do implies that keeping </p>

<p>careful control over your habitual actions is extremely important. </p>

<p>I've gotten the constant feeling that I could make a list - 1. A list of frames that I can </p>

<p>apply generally, and 2. A list of habits that I should have and behaviors that I should check for. I </p>

<p>can keep them as a running list. </p>

<p>Willpower is my critical weakness. But maybe it's not, and I've just fallen into the wrong </p>

<p>habits. The idea that there's a large difference in willpower between me and William or me and </p>

<p>Allen is possible, if they've spent a lot more time working their willpower. Doing work on time </p>

<p>and continuously for hours is an exercise that I haven't developed into a habit, and they seem to </p>

<p>have it. Can I grow that habit now? The habit of focus? </p>

<p>Here's the formula for getting rid of bad habits: First, identify the routine you want to </p>

<p>change. Second, experiment with rewards. Third, Identify the cue. Fourth, create a plan for </p>

<p>dealing with the cue. Get rid of it or change what routine you do when you experience it. Line up </p>

<p>a different behavior to get the same rewards you were searching for. </p>

<p>It's also important to focus on one habit at a time. Willpower can be weakened, and </p>

<p>avoiding a willpower crash is as important as having strong willpower in the times before.</p>
