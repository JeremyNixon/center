<p>My time is worth too much. Too much to trade all of the opportunity costs and </p>

<p>experiences that can be had in 60 hours every week for the money. Give me enough money </p>

<p>to survive and I'll spend my life in ideas, strength, books, travel, and growth. 9-5 isn't the point. </p>

<p>People are the point. So the only justification that I can have for working is that I genuinely want </p>

<p>to do whatever my 'job' is. It almost has to be a hobby that pays me. Otherwise the sacrifice of </p>

<p>time for money is just too great.</p>

<p>I want to build and create something special. I'll do that for free. But getting paid for </p>

<p>the right kinds of creation is worthwhile. Paying yourself through your creation is ideal. But the </p>

<p>money, what is it for? I've never had a predilection to consumerism, I've lived this summer in the </p>

<p>most idyllic critically intellectual anti-work working state. I work for money, but with the fewest </p>

<p>hours possible to just pay rent. It's been brilliant. I feel freer in having all this power over my </p>

<p>decisions and my life than I've ever felt. </p>

<p>Also, why go to harvard at 55 thousand a year? I can live off of 10! I'm paying for the </p>

<p>communitiy more than everything else. The money that I spend through Harvard on food in a </p>

<p>day can feed me for a week. All of the time that went into making 7 times the amount of money </p>

<p>that I need for food can be used for growth! Or for building relationships and skills that interest </p>

<p>me, can be used for anything! I'm taking out student loans to pay for college, almost entirely </p>

<p>due to my parents' financial delinquency. Thank god for Harvard's financial aid program, but it </p>

<p>calucaltes the amount that I have to pay based on what my parents (and let's be honest, what </p>

<p>my dad) make. The time that I'm going to invest in working to pay off these loans is time that </p>

<p>I could spend in so many other useful ways. This experience is so valuable to my character </p>

<p>that I shouldn't dream of dropping out and do the learning that I want full time -- there's a lot of </p>

<p>technical skills that I still need this commitment device to build, and there's a herd of friends that </p>

<p>I wouldn't have. But my time.</p>

<p>Manufactured demand really is sad. Money is spent more based on how much money </p>

<p>a person has than how much they need or want things in the world. The things worth buying </p>

<p>are experiences. But if I'm working a classic work week I have to find a way to have a fulfilling </p>

<p>lifestyle outside of my job. I can't afford to fall into stagnation, and the tedium of the work life </p>

<p>breeds that stagnation. This is the water that I need to see. As a consumer I have to maintain </p>

<p>my college perspective -- some level of minimalism that guards me against spending my time so </p>

<p>I can spend money on things that I no longer have time for.</p>
