<p class='book-title'>Antifragile</p>
  <p class="c0"><span>This book is extremely important because it exposes naive
  rationality, gives an alternative to intelligence and a theoretical foundation for
  important parts of wisdom.</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c1"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>All systems that last and thrive are those that gain from disorder.
  Time is a form of disorder, it leads to variation. If you want a system to last, either
  make it extremely robust or find a way for it to actually benefit from variation in its
  nodes. If the system is fractal, look for ways to create gains from volatility at every
  level.</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c1"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>So many of my successes have been due to upside from volatility.
  Life is long gamma. Social exploration is gains from volatility - you only keep the
  volatile upside and pay a finite cost. Emotional antifragility is the growth that comes
  out of all extremal emotion. It&rsquo;s the strong counterargument to stoicism. So many
  arguments from antifragility just seem like classic wisdom. But with this theoretic
  foundation you can look at problem solving in a new light consistently.</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c1"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Dose dependence and non-linearity are most important when we fail
  to see them. Linear models are useful for simplicity, but the model is often broken.
  Intensity as a solution for working out will be great to implement. If you&rsquo;re
  tired, you should go to the gym for exertion instead of resting. In small doses,
  exercise energizes us. Dose dependence also creates complexity in thinking - you
  can&rsquo;t just establish that a particular effect will continue to improve with
  additional amounts. That broken assumption can lead to a lot of poor
  decision.</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c1"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Innovation requires variation. It&rsquo;s likely that maximizing
  for variation is much more important than maximizing for average capacity. In most
  situations there are many many axes along which variation is important. In education,
  you can imagine philosophical focus, technical ability, approach to problem solving,
  level of systemization, etc as being more important than average capacity along a
  fragile metric. If you want innovation in an organization, giving innovators
  optionality is extremely important.</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c1"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Systematic randomness/stress/exploration is an extremely important
  source of growth.</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c1"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Humans are great at creating systems that follow power law
  distributions. I intend to ride these systems to massive payoffs. Opportunistic
  behavior will be part of the plan. And when I see situations with large variable upside
  and finite downside, I know what to do and why.</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c1"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>A moment of defense - many criticisms of fragile theorizing should
  be limited to domains where there is high kurtosis and skedasticity (fat tails and
  power distributions) as well as complex (interconnected, positive feedback) payoffs.
  Theorizing in other domains can be extremely helpful, and determinate optimism has
  empirical backing, a type of wisdom that Antifragile would endorse.</span></p>
