<h2 class="growth">Growth as a Way of Life</h2>
<p>
Reference Dependence kills everything.
</p><p>
Your joy at having won the lottery? You adjust your expectation. Gone after a few short months. 
</p><p>
Sadness too - your pain at having lost a leg, or lost a job? Shift your reference point. Gone after a few short months, as life returns to normal.
</p><p>
Won a championship? Glory flashes, but then back to the grind. The crowning achievements of our lives, exposed and vulnerable to reference dependence.
</p><p>
We adjust to change. And so achievement becomes hollow as soon as our expectation shifts to be the level that we’re at. Meeting that expectation becomes the new standard. 
</p><p>
I wanted to escape. Meeting standard wasn’t good enough, and standard is shifty. And so instead of placing the weight determining my happiness on results, I turned to the first derivative: growth.
</p><p>
Growth has a reference point too. But the beautiful thing is that that reference point barely adjusts. It’s adjustment is slow, and year after year of bliss in exceeding that expectation can follow. 
</p><p>
The cultural obsession with growth that we'are immersed in is our <a href="http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~drkelly/DFWKenyonAddress2005.pdf">water</a>. But what fuels that burn? What's the theory behind the heuristic? Defeating reference dependence does some of the work.
</p><p>
The beautiful thing is that a focus shift to growth turns the day to day object level behavior that drives success into the goal, in and of itself. You can ask yourself about growth on a weekly or even daily basis. The feedback loop shrinks dramatically, and so you hijack the reward cycle that drives so much passion seeking behavior.
</p><p>
And so there is escape. Escape from f(x) to the higher derivatives. To places that reference dependence lags. Accomplishment is fleeting, but growth looks like daily satisfaction.
