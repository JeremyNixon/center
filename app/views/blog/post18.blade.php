<h2 class='post_title'>Idea Flow</h2>
<p>
Idea flow is the name I give to the visceral sense that ideas are moving through your life at speed - you can think of it as a rate, a number of ideas per day, that create a sense of intellectual exploration and growth.
</p><p>
The greatest speeds have been achieved with dramatic amounts of reading. The experiment from Sophomore summer where I read 4 books a week is the prime example. My mind was chock full and flying each and every day.
</p><p>
Idea flow always exists, the question is how much is there and how does it feel. As a hyperanalytic addict, I find that it’s invigorating and look to maximize it (constrained optimization). I also have searched for ways to capture as much of the flow as possible and install it into habitual thought.
</p><p>
A few methods that consistently generate flow:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Write. Free Writing, Essays, Book Writing, etc.
</li><li>
Find the best online communities that I can and comment/post about topics that I care about in the space.
</li><li>Idea Lists. Time limited brainstorming, forcing myself to get to a high count.
</li><li>Read. 4 books a week was the time of greatest idea flow for me. Doing that as a lifestyle was insane - it looks something like 30 hours a week. 
</li><li>Social - Meeting regularly with my smartest friends. 
</li><li>Professors. They give the best worldview critiques and are great for looking up solutions and generating ideas.
</li><li>Taking the best books and compress them into runable algorithms. And then running them regularly.
</li><li>Set out all of the best ideas in a field or space. Search exhaustively. And then compress the space into the strongest and most general ideas, and train thinking with that frame.
</li><li>Focus on fundamentals of thinking - take a few core principles and apply them all the time everywhere.
</li><li>Monitor my thought, ask myself what it’s doing when it’s going well.
</li>
</ol>
