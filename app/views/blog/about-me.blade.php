<h2 class='post_title'>About</h2><br>
<p>
I titled this blog Hyperanalytic because I love thinking more than anything else in this world. Introspection, insight, problem solving, calculation, systemization - my life blood.
</p><p>
The ideas that move me are spread through a few domains. They’re in Machine Learning and Game Theory, Artificial Intelligence and Behavioral Economics. Data Science, Statistics, Cognitive and Social Psychology, and Philosophy.
</p><p>
I’m from the books that I’ve read as much as from the places I’I alve been. Authors were my first true, close friends. Orson Scott Card. Rowling, Cialdini, Nietzsche, Hume. Kahneman. Taleb. Thiel. A bibliophile. I read as much as I can, usually ~2 books a week.
</p><p>
Experimentation fuels so much of my growth. Time tracking, Free Writing, Social Exploration, Idea Lists, Courage Challenges, Polyphasic Sleep, Social Commitment, and so many more have taught me more about myself, my body, and my environment than I could ever have gotten from reading alone.
</p><p>
Games were formative. Of strategy, insight, conquest, tactics, glory. Ultimate, Civilization, High School, Starcraft, Pokemon. I’m a sucker for competitive incentive structures. They get me. The light a fire and create feedback loops that have created so much value in my life.
</p><p>
I’m from people. From Will Miller and Brad Matola. From Amy Wells and Thaddeus Main and the Roberts Twins. From Carolyn and Misha and Chris and Andrew and Vincent and Hikari. 
</p><p>
I just graduated from Harvard with a degree in Applied Mathematics to Computer Science and Economics. 
</p><p>
Currently, I’m greedily pushing towards mastery of predictive modeling, machine learning 
and artificial intelligence by reading through The Elements of Statistical Learning, Applied Predictive Modeling, an Introduction to Statistical Learning, and Machine Learning: A Probabilistic 
Perspective. I’m attempting to write down and understand every important algorithm in the space, and so I’m coding them up from scratch and putting them into a library called Oracle. I’m also
 modeling on Kaggle and working on myriad side projects in machine learning.

 If you want to model with me, talk to me about career opportunities in Data Science or Machine Learning, or talk about the site, contact me at jnixon2@gmail.com.
