Wow. What a month. Let it be known that this february was one of the happiest months of my life. The change was so so positive.

A shortlist: 

New brilliant, fascinating friends.
Courses where the material is really important.
Idea flow, every day. Driven by intellectual relationships. 
Goals on many horizons, achieved at unprecedented levels
Huge advances in my worldview and ability to think
Obsession and success on Kaggle in CS 181
Success in algorithmic game theory competition
Romantic exploration, and the end of a pained relationship
New projects - on focus, heroes, learning, ideas, and many more
Harvard Lifehack, Junto, EA, and associated events and relationships

I fucking love my life.

I can make it even better.

This month is going to be similar socially, but I’m going to focus my big wins to be on academics and career. This is the month where I start my job search in real, earnest attack at companies that I’m inspired by. This is the month where I learn how to turn in perfect problem sets and get extremely good at algorithms and machine learning through data ventures, side projects and courses. I have so many resources just waiting to be exhausted. 

I know what I have to do, and I know how to build an environment where I’ll execute. Let’s go!

All of this said, who has actually been valuable?

Andrew
Vincent
Christopher
Aaron
Brandon Sim

Basically, the easy conclusion is that I should stick to the worthy and cull everybody else. It’s actually really really obvious that this is a good idea. I know who I want to be around. I should just do that. 

I want to do this semester right academically. That means that I’ll have to get up and read tomorrow morning - I want to have actually done my readings. I need 2 hours for Machine Learning and 1 hour for Economics and computation. I want to actually do these readings before class, and have notes that I can simply fill in. This means not starting my 124 problem set (probably) until way too late. 

It’s also extremely important that I sleep properly. This is likely critical for my productivity, and for my sanity. There’s going to be so much going on. 

It’s really important that I get on top of 124 tomorrow. That’s all that my focus can be on. 

What was my stop doing list?

I need to speak the truth about my abilities. I need to grow! So I need to be truthful. I need to recognize my limitations and be more comfortable sharing them with the people who I know can help me.
