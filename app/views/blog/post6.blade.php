<h2 style="text-align: center">Conversation with Scott Kominers</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center">GTD</h3>
<p>
Scott applies Google Docs for some lists. The GTD system holds ideas, easy action steps for a lot of projects, books
Impact is on having complete confidence that everything you need to do is in the system
Benefits from short stretches of time where you can blow through tasks
</p>
<p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">Ideas from academia to innovation</h3>
Using data and statistics to learn about the world, grab up a lot of low hanging fruit
Data science should be automatable
Chicago - low hanging fruit in police data
Likely to be some new discovery in statistics to get at other insights that are less obvious to current data science but sill help world understanding
Sustainability
Figuring out how to preserve important resources that are under strain 
Recommendation: The Idea Factory
</p>
<p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">Evolutionary Stability</h3>
Identify markets with equilibria, see whether or not they can be changed with game theory
Market for doctors (where doctors can renege on hospital) vs market for law clerks (cannot renege) as extremely similar but subtly different
Small change to trading market (batching trades in milliseconds) to shut down inefficiencies from HFT (kind of like google and second price auction)
</p>
<p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">Academics and Market Design</h3>
Academics as a tradeoff between freedom and insignificance. But Scott Kominers doesn’t care. 
</p>
<p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">Abstraction</h3>
In general, reasonable method for decision making until abstractions stop mapping to concrete things and become purely theoretical
Questions require granularity to be answered. Meta questions can also be answered - talk to a VC, for example, about broad things, but if you have specific questions about improving innovation in biotechnology, you can be pointed to the right people
</p>
<p>
Very conservative answering questions - gave no answer (“I haven’t thought about it enough”) to questions about the incentive structure in academics
</p>
<p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">Market Design</h3>
Any system with incentives over actors making decisions
Economics as an engineering problem
He’s writing an overview of the ideas in market design right now
Recommendation: Al Roth, The Economist’s Engineer
Recommendation: Al Roth, Who Gets What and Why, Popular Press
