<p>iv. There should be synchrony between the magnitude of an event </p>

<p>example)</p>

<p>deception</p>

<p>and the emotions shown.</p>

<p>Body language is a super power. There's a world of communicated ideas that is just </p>

<p>waiting to be observed. Those thoughts are more true and important than the spoken word. </p>

<p>The first and epochal conclusion is that I should PRACTICE observation. Every moment </p>

<p>my eyes are open is an opportunity for making associations between objects and ideas. </p>

<p>Those associations lead to inferential information that can help complete my understanding of </p>

<p>people, their motives, feelings, passion etc. There is value in all observations. Body language </p>

<p>specifically should be analyzed by system 2 as often as possible. I need to train myself in </p>

<p>recognition and in portrayal. </p>

<p>I've been interested for a long time on Holmes level observation skills. An important </p>

<p>point to realize is that practicing observation is valuable continuously. Every day that I practice </p>

<p>or improve a little bit will enhance my conversations and understanding of people by that </p>

<p>little bit. So let's design some observation experiments. Holmes' father would quiz him on his </p>

<p>surroundings. They'd walk into a restaurant and after they sat down he would ask sherlock how </p>

<p>many people were wearing hats. Quizzes on unexpected aspects of environment could be really </p>

<p>good if I could get people that I was with on board with it. </p>

<p>But realistically I'm going to be training myself. I should read a book on observation to </p>

<p>make sure I don't lose interest or focus on it again. If I find a way to make improving </p>

<p>observations skills habitual I know I can make some great progress. </p>

<p>I may start a conversation journal. The best way to learn how to be social successfully is </p>

<p>by talking to a lot of people. But like any other skill, it would be silly to just run around doing it </p>

<p>without reflecting on my experiences, my recognitions, what worked and what didn't, and what I </p>

<p>loved about it. Being a good conversationalist starts with material but is really found in a deep </p>

<p>understanding of the other person's tone, thoughts, body language, etc. and being able to bodily </p>

<p>and interestingly respond. If I write down the body language poses that I used, how they felt in </p>

<p>conversation, what the other person was doing, etc., I'll have a real incentive to observe them </p>

<p>critically. </p>

<p>I should compile a list of the body languages and associated emotions/feelings that I </p>

<p>see. Most books on body language are actually basically dictionaries or encyclopedias. The </p>

<p>have a comunicated pose and a definition with explaination. Reading a book like that could be </p>

<p>useful for any journal that I write. Also, rereading the journal as reflection can be fascinating.</p>

<p>This fbi agent was probably trained. I may be able to access training protocol online, and </p>

<p>see what kinds of skills they value. Classic spies have an ability to decieve and a social mask </p>

<p>that should be impenetrable. Maybe social experiments where I have to try on different </p>

<p>personalities, a bit like in Burn Notice. I'm facing social challenges every day, and the person </p>

<p>that I am is occasionally the right person to deal with those challenges but I can usually run </p>

<p>somebody else on them to better match their personality. You would never genuinely run </p>

<p>yourself on your mom or a slew of other people. Be more systematic about deciding how you're </p>

<p>going to interact with people. </p>

<p>On recognition. People are constantly exhibiting pacification, orienting legs toward, </p>

<p>away, over, pointing in directions, using their torsos to signal interest or apathy, distrust or fear </p>

<p>by protecting themselves. Take note of how what you say makes them pacify or not pacify. </p>

<p>There are so many small and valuable indicators. </p>

<p>Touching should be a default of human communication. Establish it. Let it be weird when </p>

<p>you're not touching the person you're talking to. Hearty handshakes with eye contact, slaps </p>

<p>on the back or clasps of the shoulder, touches on the arm and head or a hand on the leg, slip </p>

<p>physicality into personal communication as much as is productively possible.</p>
